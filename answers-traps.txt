5. outcome - HE110 World
6. value - 1, The compiler doesn't analyse the format string and 
  determine that an integer argument is missing. The fact that 
  you are missing an argument is a semantic issue that only appears 
  at runtime. The printf function will assume that you have 
  supplied the argument and go looking for it on the stack. 
  It will pick up whatever happens to be on there.
